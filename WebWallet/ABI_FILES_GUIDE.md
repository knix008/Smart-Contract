# ABI Files Location Guide

## 📂 Where to Find ABI Files

The ABI (Application Binary Interface) files are located in the `compiled/` directory:

```
WebWallet/
├── compiled/
│   ├── MyToken.json      ← Use this for MyToken/ERC20 contracts
│   └── SimpleToken.json  ← Use this for SimpleToken contracts
```

## 🔨 If ABI Files Don't Exist

Run one of these commands to compile your contracts:

```bash
# Compile MyToken (advanced ERC20)
npm run compile:erc20

# Compile SimpleToken (basic ERC20)  
npm run compile:simple

# Use the interactive helper
./compile-helper.sh
```

## 📋 Using ABI Files

### In Web Interface:
1. Go to "🚀 Deploy Contract" or "🔗 Interact with Contract" tab
2. Click "📁 Load" or "📁 Load ABI" button
3. Select file from `compiled/` directory:
   - `MyToken.json` - for advanced ERC20 features
   - `SimpleToken.json` - for basic ERC20 functionality

### File Contents:
Each JSON file contains:
- `abi`: Contract's Application Binary Interface
- `bytecode`: Compiled contract bytecode
- `contractName`: Name of the contract

## 🔗 Quick Access

- **Deploy**: Use these files in the deployment tab
- **Interact**: Upload the same files to interact with deployed contracts
- **Command Line**: Scripts automatically use these files from `compiled/` directory

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- These files are generated by compilation - don't edit manually
- Re-compile if you change the Solidity source code
- Both deployment and interaction use the same JSON files
- Files contain everything needed for deployment and interaction
