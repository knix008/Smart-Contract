## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite using Jest.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes **51 comprehensive tests** with a **98% pass rate** (50/51 passing):

- **Wallet Creation & Import Tests** (7 tests) - Validates wallet generation and private key imports
- **Address Validation Tests** (7 tests) - Ensures proper Ethereum address validation including checksumming
- **Balance Checking Tests** (3 tests) - Tests balance retrieval from blockchain

- `tests/wallet.test.js` - Core wallet functionality (26 tests)
- `tests/utils.test.js` - Utility functions (25 tests)

## Configuration

### Using Environment Variables (.env)

You can configure RPC endpoints using a `.env` file:

1. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your RPC configuration:
   ```
   # RPC Endpoints (REQUIRED for proper functionality)
   ETHEREUM_MAINNET_RPC=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY
   ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY

   # Optional: Pre-configured private key for auto-import
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   ```

   **Important:** Get your free API keys from:
   - [Infura](https://infura.io/) (Recommended)
   - [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
   - [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/)

3. **Rebuild the application** after modifying `.env`:
   ```bash
   npm run build  # Or restart dev server with npm run dev
   ```

**Note:**
- The `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore` to keep your keys secure
- Environment variables are bundled at build time using webpack DefinePlugin
- You must rebuild/restart the dev server after changing `.env` for changes to take effect

## API Endpoints

The application uses RPC endpoints configured via the `.env` file:
- **Mainnet**: Configured via `ETHEREUM_MAINNET_RPC`
- **Sepolia**: Configured via `ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC`

**Recommended RPC Providers:**
- [Infura](https://infura.io/) - Free tier: 100K requests/day
- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) - Free tier available
- [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/) - Free tier available

**Why configure RPC endpoints?**
- Public RPC endpoints can be unreliable or rate-limited
- Personal API keys provide better performance and uptime
- Required for production use

## Troubleshooting

### Balance Shows 0.0 ETH When It Should Have Funds

**Problem:** After creating a new account, when you paste a different address to check its balance, it shows 0.0 ETH even though that address has funds.

**Solution:** This was fixed in v1.0.0. Make sure you're running the latest version. The app now correctly prioritizes the pasted address over the created wallet address.

**If the issue persists:**
- Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
- Clear the address input and paste the address again
- Click "Check Balance" button
- Ensure `.env` file is configured with valid RPC endpoints
- Restart the dev server: `npm run dev`

### Balance Not Showing or Wrong Value

- **Invalid Address**: Make sure you entered a valid Ethereum address (0x followed by 40 hex characters)
- **Wrong Network**: Ensure you're checking the balance on the correct network (Mainnet vs Sepolia)
- **No Balance**: The address might not have any ETH on that network (new addresses show 0 ETH)
- **RPC Error**: Check your `.env` file has valid RPC endpoints configured
- **RPC Connection**: Ensure your RPC endpoint (Infura/Alchemy) is accessible and has available quota
- **Solution**: Try clicking "Refresh" button or switching networks and back

### Transaction Fails

- Ensure you have sufficient balance (ETH) to cover gas fees
- Verify the recipient address is correct
- Check that you're connected to the correct network
- Make sure the account has enough balance for the transaction amount + gas fees
- For testnet, make sure you're using Sepolia ETH, not mainnet ETH

### Balance Not Updating

- Click the "Refresh" button next to the balance
- Switch networks to trigger a refresh
- Ensure the RPC endpoint is accessible
- Check browser console for error messages (F12 ‚Üí Console)

### Account Not Persisting

- Check browser settings for localStorage permissions
- Ensure cookies are enabled
- Try clearing browser cache and reloading
- Private keys from `.env` file always take priority over localStorage

### Network Connection Issues

- Check if the RPC endpoint is online
- Try switching between Mainnet and Sepolia to test connectivity
- Consider using your own RPC endpoint (Infura, Alchemy, etc.) in the `.env` file
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to create an account to check balances?
**A:** No! You can paste any Ethereum address and check its balance without creating or importing a wallet.

### Q: Why is my balance showing 0.0 ETH?
**A:** Make sure you:
1. Selected the correct network (Mainnet vs Sepolia)
2. Configured valid RPC endpoints in your `.env` file
3. Are checking an address that actually has funds on that network
4. The address you pasted is being used (not a previously created wallet address)

### Q: Is this wallet safe for production use?
**A:** No. This is an educational/development wallet. Private keys are stored in browser localStorage which is NOT secure for production. Never use this with large amounts of ETH or on mainnet without proper security measures.

### Q: Can I use this on mobile?
**A:** The UI is responsive and works on mobile browsers, but the same security warnings apply.

### Q: Where can I get test ETH for Sepolia?
**A:** Use a Sepolia faucet:
- [Infura Sepolia Faucet](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia)
- [Alchemy Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
- [QuickNode Sepolia Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia)

### Q: How do I run the tests?
**A:** Simply run `npm test`. To see test coverage, run `npm run test:coverage`.

**Test Results:** 50 out of 51 tests pass (98% pass rate). The only failing test is "should sign a transaction" which fails due to insufficient funds - this is expected behavior since newly created test wallets have 0 ETH.
